# Lagrangian-Modeling-Basics
This rpository contains jupyter notebooks utilising the sympy library to simulate simple mechanical 2D systems based on Lagrangian mechanics as a self experimenting/self learning process. Below there are two examples of these systems a double pendulum system and a Piston Flywheel system.
